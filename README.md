# SuperscalarSIM
### Superscalar Simulator (ALPHA version) based on Tomasulo's Algorithm

The purpose of this project is to help students of computer engineering understand the concepts of superscalarity in microprocessor architecture.

This program consists of a simulator for a superscalar architecture based on Tomasulo's algorithm. 

This is an alpha version with the purpose of being evaluated and improved. Any contributions are welcomed.

## How to use it

#### Requiremens

- Java 10 or lower

#### Starting the Simulator
You can use one of the scripts in this folder to run, compile or build the entire project. The .ps1 files are Windows/PowerShell scripts but can be executed in Linux. (except build script). There's also available a JRE 8 compiled version in the **dist** folder. To use it just double click on the **SuperscalarSIM.jar**. You can either run it from terminal.

```sh
 $ java -jar dist/SuperscalarSIM.jar 
```

#### Opening an *Assembly Code*
Once started, go to **File** menu, then **Open Program**. It will appear a file selection window. Select a pseudo MIPS assemply file and click **Open**. Some examples are available in the **test** folder. After selecting the file the assembly code will appear in the memory block, represented by the left side table.

#### Configuring Operational Parameters
On the **Configuration** menu it's possible to select different pipeline execution options.

- Operational Units
    - Second ALU Unit
    - Second FP Unit
    - Second Memory Unit
    ----
    - 2-line Buffer
    - 3-line Buffer

- Pipeline Ways
    - 1-way Pipeline
    - 2-way Pipeline
    - 4-way Pipeline

#### Executing the Code
Now you'll be able to see the instructions flowing through the pipeline one clock tick at a time.

Every time you click on the **Next** button, at the left lower side, you push the execution ahead one clock cycle. Thus the simulator will evalute every pipeline stage. The menu command **File** -> **Run** have the same purpose.
